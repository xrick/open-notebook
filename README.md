# Open Notebook

An open source, privacy-focused alternative to Google's Notebook LM. Why give Google more of our data when we can take control of our own research workflows?

In a world dominated by Artificial Intelligence, having the ability to think 🧠 and acquire new knowledge 💡, is a skill that should not be a privilege for a few, nor restricted to a single company.

Open Notebook empowers you to manage your research, generate AI-assisted notes, and interact with your content—on your terms.
